## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- UniFi Controller (self-hosted or Cloud Key)
- Network access to your UniFi Controller

## Installation

### Download Pre-built App
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag UniGlo to your Applications folder
4. Launch UniGlo from Applications

### Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UniGlo.git
cd UniGlo

# Build the application
./build_app.sh

# The app will be built and opened automatically
```

## Usage

### First-Time Setup
1. Launch UniGlo
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Enter your UniFi Controller details:
   - Controller URL (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1:8443`)
   - Username
   - Password
4. Enable "Accept Self-Signed Certificates" if using a local controller
5. Click **Save Settings**

### Managing Devices
1. Navigate to the **Devices** tab
2. Click **Refresh** to load your access points
3. Use the toggle switches to control individual LEDs
4. Use **Turn On All LEDs** or **Turn Off All LEDs** for bulk control

### Creating Schedules
1. Go to the **Schedules** tab
2. Click **Add Schedule** (or equivalent button)
3. Name your schedule
4. Configure rules for each day:
   - Set ON time (when LEDs should turn on)

5. Enable the schedule
6. Save your changes

The scheduler runs in the background and will automatically execute your configured schedules.

## Architecture

UniGlo is built with modern Swift and SwiftUI:

- **SwiftUI**: Native macOS user interface
- **Swift Package Manager**: Dependency management
- **Sparkle**: Automatic update framework
- **Keychain Services**: Secure credential storage
- **URLSession**: Network communication with UniFi Controller
- **UserDefaults & Core Data**: Local data persistence

## Privacy & Security

- **Local-First**: All data is stored locally on your Mac
- **Keychain Integration**: Credentials are securely stored in macOS Keychain
- **No Telemetry**: UniGlo doesn't collect or transmit any usage data
- **Direct Connection**: Communicates directly with your UniFi Controller
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for review

## Known Limitations

- Requires direct network access to UniFi Controller
- Controller must be running UniFi Network Application
- LED control is limited to features exposed by the UniFi API

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Controller
- Verify your controller URL is correct (include `https://` and port)
- Check that "Accept Self-Signed Certificates" is enabled for local controllers
- Ensure your Mac can reach the controller on the network
- Verify your username and password are correct

### Schedules Not Running
- Check that the schedule is enabled
- Verify the on/off times are set correctly
- Ensure UniGlo is running (it can run in the background)
- Check the system logs for any error messages

### Devices Not Appearing
- Click the **Refresh** button in the Devices tab
- Verify your credentials in Settings
- Ensure your access points are online and adopted
